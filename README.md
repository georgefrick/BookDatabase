============

This is an example of Backbone.js Mustache.js Jquery wired to Java EE 6 Restful web services.

If you are learning backbone or you want to see an example of how easy Java EE 6 makes restful web
services than this is a good example.

The rest services are handled via JAX-RS, with the jboss resteasy implementation (but you don't have to use jboss).

I deploy this example to Tomcat 7. (See POM)

Dependencies:

UI:
Jquery
backbone.js
underscore.js
mustache.js (templating)
json2.js

Backend:
See pom.xml
